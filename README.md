## 🧠 Overview

This project is an **interactive 3D Rubik’s Cube simulator** built completely from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
The highlight of this project is a **custom-built animation engine** written in JavaScript, designed to handle smooth rotations, transitions, and interactive user input — all without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

The cube behaves like a real one — you can **rotate, scramble, and solve** it in your browser with realistic motion and intuitive controls.

## ✨ Features

- 🌀 **3D Cube Simulation** using CSS `transform` and `perspective`
- ⚙️ **Custom JavaScript Animation Engine** for smooth frame-based rendering
- 🧩 **Fully Interactive Cube** (click, drag, rotate)
- 💫 **Realistic Motion** with easing and timing functions
- ⌨️ **Keyboard & Mouse Controls**
- 🔄 **Scramble / Reset / Solve options**
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – works across all screen sizes
- 🧠 **Optimized Game Logic** for performance and accuracy

## ⚙️ The Animation Engine

The **animation engine** powers all cube movements and transitions by:

- Managing a **render loop** using `requestAnimationFrame()`  
- Handling **timed interpolations (tweening)** for smooth transitions  
- Supporting **easing functions** for realistic cube motion  
- Providing **modular control** for cube face and global rotations  
- Offering **custom event hooks** for animation start/stop  

> 🧩 This engine can be extended to animate any 3D or 2D object — making it a reusable module beyond the cube!
